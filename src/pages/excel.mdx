### "Data flows through blocks"

Each data blocks holds a dataset and acts as a transformation pipeline to the next block. The pipeline looks as follows:

-   a data block receives an updated dataset from its predecessor
-   (optionally) the data block transforms the dataset. For example, it can sort the data according to a column.
-   (optionally) update charts or tables
-   the data block pushes the data to its successors

### ðŸ‘€ Data preview

The data blocks have a data preview button ðŸ‘€ that allows to quickly glance at the dataset attached to the block. If a block also transforms the dataset, a before/after view is provided.

### Charts on the fly

Add charts as you transform the data.

### Discover transforms

Blocks are great to discover the vocabulary of a language. This also applies with data science.
