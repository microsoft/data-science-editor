# Out of the Box

The micro:bit V2 from the Kit comes with a preloaded firmware that will use the Jacdac modules

## What to expect?

-   Plug the micro:bit into the Jacdaptor (make sure the front of the micro:bit and raised numbers on the plastic edge connector of Jacdaptor are both visible)

-   Supply power to the micro:bit

-   When a Jacdac module is added to or removed from the bus, the micro:bit displays the new count of devices on the bus

-   When a Jacdac button module is attached, the micro:bit will respond to the following events as follows

    -   Down: display a first icon on 5x5 LEDs and play a note (eight different icons and notes supported, for up to eight buttons)
    -   Hold: display a second icon
    -   Up: clear display

-   When a Jacdac sensor (slider, rotary encoder, thermometer) is attached and the sensor value changes appreciably,
    micro:bit will display a bar chart showing the magnitude of the reading register, or will display the value as a number

-   When a Jacdac actuator (LED pixel strip, single LED) is attached, the micro:bit will send a command to it based
    on which button of micro:bit is pressed (A, B, A+B)

-   When a Jacdac HID brain 
    ([JM Brain F4 v0.2](/devices/microsoft/research/jmbrainf441v02) or [JM Brain RP2040 v0.1](/devices/microsoft/research/jmbrainrp204059v01) module) 
    and a joystick are connected, the joystick will move the mouse.
-   When a Jacdac HID brain (see above) and a button are connected, the button will trigger mouse left-button clicks.

-   When a LED pixel strip and a potentiometer (slider) are connected, the potentiometer will control the LED brightness
-   When a LED pixel strip and a rotary encoder are connected, the rotary encoder will rotate the LEDs on the strip
