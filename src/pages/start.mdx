# Getting started with Jacdac

Jacdac is a platform for quick and easy prototyping of new
electronic experiences. This page reviews how to get started if you 
have hardware, as well as how get started programming using Jacdac device simulators, which doesn't require hardware. 
Visit the [device catalog](/devices) to see what Jacdac devices are available.

We focus here on the [micro:bit V2](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/) as the programmable "brain" and Kittenbot's [Jacdac Starter Kit A with Jacdaptor for micro:bit V2](/devices/kittenbot/jacdacstarterkitawithjacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/); other Jacdac [brains, modules, and jacdaptors](/reference/clientserver) will available soon. 

## Working with hardware and the device dashboard

Visit the Jacdac [device dashboard](/dashboard) and connect your device
which allows you to visualize the **device twins** for each connected modules.
Each connected module will automatically appear in the device dashboard as a **device twin**,
mirroring the state of the device. Each Jacdac service describes a basic electronic feature, such as a
[button](/services/button) or [potentiometer](/services/potentiometer).

**If you micro:bit does not connect**, try downloading the [micro:bit Jukebox](/clients/makecode/microbit-jukebox/)!

## Simulators

Start a button simulator and slider simulator, by clicking on the button icon and then searching for the slider simulator
as shown below:

## Programming with simulators

You can dive into programming with simulators using a variety of [client programming languages](/clients) supported by Jacdac. **These very same programs will work against Jacdac devices**, no software change required, when connected to the computer (brain) running the client code. You can also program freely against a mix of simulators and Jacdac devices.
A brain can be a battery-powered Jacdac device, like a micro:bit V2, or a laptop/desktop computer.The Jacdac object model and supporting runtime is available for:
* [MakeCode](/clients/makecode)
* [JavaScript/TypeScript](/clients/javascript)
* [.NET](/clients/dotnet) 
* [Python](/clients/python)

### MakeCode

To get started programming with MakeCode, browse the [MakeCode Jacdac projects](/clients/makecode/projects).
From here, you can open MakeCode directly with the push of a button,
loading the needed Jacdac libraries. MakeCode has in-browser programming and
integrates the Jacdac simulators into the debugging experience.

### .NET

[Get started with .NET](/clients/dotnet/getting-started/)
to program with Jacdac (no hardware required) in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp). After this, you can try out some of the [.NET Jacdac Projects](/clients/dotnet/projects/).

### JavaScript/TypeScript

If you program in JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use create a web page or a Node.JS script to execute Jacdac applications. Read more about [getting started with JavaScript/TypeScript](/clients/javascript).

### Python

[Get started with Python](/clients/python/), which also supports connecting to the web-hosted device dashboard.
More projects coming soon.
