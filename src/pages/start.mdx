# Getting started with Jacdac

Jacdac is a platform for quick and easy prototyping of new
electronic experiences. This page reviews how to get started if you 
have hardware, as well as how get started programming using Jacdac device simulators, which doesn't require hardware. 
Visit the [device catalog](/devices) to see what Jacdac devices are available.

We focus here on the [micro:bit V2](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/) as the programmable [brain](/start/brain) and Kittenbot's [Jacdac Starter Kit A with Jacdaptor for micro:bit V2](/devices/kittenbot/jacdacstarterkitawithjacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/); other Jacdac [brains](/start/brains), [modules](/start/modules), and [jacdaptors](/start/jacdaptors) will available soon. 

## Working with hardware and the device dashboard

Visit the Jacdac [device dashboard](/dashboard) and connect your device
which allows you to visualize the **device twins** for each connected modules.
Each connected module will automatically appear in the device dashboard as a **device twin**,
mirroring the state of the device. Each Jacdac service describes a basic electronic feature, such as a
[button](/services/button) or [potentiometer](/services/potentiometer).

If **your micro:bit does not connect** to the Jacdac device dashboard, 
try downloading the [micro:bit Jukebox](/clients/makecode/microbit-jukebox/) onto your micro:bit. 
In addition to reacting to Jacdac modules as they are plugged in, the micro:bit will pass Jacdac 
communications to your computer over USB.

## Simulators

Start a button simulator and slider simulator, by clicking on the button icon and then searching for the slider simulator
as shown below:

## Programming with simulators

Once you are familiar with Jacdac simulators you can dive into programming
using a variety of [client programming languages](/clients)
supported by Jacdac. Programs developed using simulated devices **will also work with real Jacdac devices**,
no software changes required! Just connect some or all of the devices used by your code to your computer and re-run
your client code. You can also program a Jacdac 'brain' to run your client code, so that your project works even
when the Jacdac devices are not connected to a computer.

The Jacdac APIs are available in [JavaScript/TypeScript](/clients/javascript),
[.NET](/clients/dotnet), and [Python](/clients/python), as well as [MakeCode](/clients/makecode). **The easiest way to get started with Jacdac right now is with MakeCode.** 
Jacdac support for .NET and Python is still in beta. JavaScript/TypeScript
provides a very complete but more complex set of APIs.

### MakeCode

To get started programming with MakeCode, browse the [MakeCode Jacdac projects](/clients/makecode/projects).
From here, you can open MakeCode directly with the push of a button,
automatically loading all the relevant Jacdac libraries. MakeCode has in-browser programming and
integrates the Jacdac simulators into its in-browser debugging experience.

### .NET

[Get started with .NET](/clients/dotnet/getting-started/)
to program with Jacdac (no hardware required) in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp). 
After this, you can try out some of the [.NET Jacdac Projects](/clients/dotnet/projects/).

### Python

[Get started with Python](/clients/python/), which also supports connecting to the web-hosted device dashboard.
More projects coming soon.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

If you program in JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use create a web page or a Node.JS script to execute Jacdac applications.
