## Where can I get Jacdac devices?

Please visit the Jacdac [device catalog](/devices) to find what devices are available and where to purchase them.

## Can I use Jacdac without hardware?

Yes! Jacdac provides web-based simulators for most of its [services](/services),
and has been integrated with web-based programming environments like [MakeCode](/clients/makecode).

## What happens if I short-circuit the Jacdac pins?

We require that all Jacdac power supplies have current limiting built into them. This means that any short-circuits on the Jacdac bus are automatically detected and cause power delivery to be suspended. Within less than a second of the short-circuit being removed, power will automatically resume. This interruption of power will, of course, cause Jacdac devices that are powered from the bus to switch off for a short time; they will then reset when power resumes.
