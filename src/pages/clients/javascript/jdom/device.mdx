# JDDevice

A **device** is a [JDOM](/clients/javascript/jdom/) [node](/clients/javascript/jdom/node/)
that hosts [services](/clients/javascript/jdom/service/). A device is hosted in a [bus](/clients/javascript/jdom/bus/).

This object inherits methods and properties from [node](/clients/javascript/jdom/node/).

```vanilla
const devices = bus.devices();
-----
import { DEVICE_ANNOUNCE } from "jacdac-ts"

log(`connect to see devices`)
// listen for device announcing services
bus.on(DEVICE_ANNOUNCE, () => {
    // query the current list of devices
    const devices = bus.devices()
    // print to console
    log("")
    for(const device of devices)
        log(device)
})
```

## Methods

### ```name```

Retreives the short hash name or the name given to this device in the bus.

```javascript
console.log(`hello ${device.name}`)
```

### ```announced```

It is possible to receive a packet from an unknown device before an announcement packet has been received.

```javascript
if(!device.annonced) {

}
```

### ``services``

    console.log(service)
}
```

### ``service``

Retreives the service by **service index** in the device. Undefined if not found.

```javascript
const service = device.service(pkt.serviceIndex)
```
