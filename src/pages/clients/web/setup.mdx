# Distributions

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into your web projects.

## NPM

Add the [jacdac-ts npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jacdac-ts) module 
to your project

```
npm install --save-dev jacdac-ts
```

then import components as needed using ES6 import syntax

```javascript
import { createUSBBus } -ts
const jd = createUSBBus()
```

## CDN / UMD

You can also use CDN services to import ``jacdac`` into your html page directly.
This will load the library as a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) mode.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jacdac-ts@VERSION"></script>
```

where ``@VERSION`` is the desired version. 
All exports are defined under the ``jacdac`` namespace.

```javascript
const jd = jacdac.createUSBBus()
```
