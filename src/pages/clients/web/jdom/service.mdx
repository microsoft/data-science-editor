# JDService

> A **service** is a [JDOM](/clients/web/jdom/) [node](/clients/web/jdom/node/)
that has [registers](/clients/web/jdom/register/), [events](/clients/web/jdom/event/), accept **commands**
and may return **acks**. A service is hosted in a [device](/clients/web/jdom/device/).

This object inherits methods and properties from [node](/clients/web/jdom/node/).

## Methods

### ``serviceClass``

Returns the unique service identifier for the service.

```typescript
const srvid = service.serviceClass;
```

### ``register``

This function returns a [register](/clients/web/jdom/register/) object mapped at a given address.
You can use register to read and write data to the service.

```typescript
const register = service.register(0x42);
```

### ``event``

This function returns an [event](/clients/web/jdom/event/) object mapped at a given address.
You can use an event to listen to events coming from the device.

```typescript
const event = service.event(0x42);
```

### ``specification``

For services listed in the [specification](/services/), returns a specification instance 
that lists all the commands and registers of the service.

```typescript
const spec = service.specification;
console.log(spec)
```

### ``sendPacketAsync``

Sends a packet of data to the service. This function returns a promise.

```typescript
await service.sendPacketAsync(pkt)
```

### ``sendCmdAsync``

A helper function to send command packets, which only contain a header.

```typescript
await service.sendCmdAsync(CMD_CALIBRATE)
```

## Events

### ``PACKET_SEND``

Raised before a packet is sent to the service.

```typescript
service.on(PACKET_SEND, pkt => console.log(`${this} send ${pkt}`))
```

### ``PACKET_RECEIVE``

Raised when a packet has been received and before it is being processed.

```typescript
service.on(PACKET_SEND, pkt => console.log(`${this} received ${pkt}`))
```
