# Relay

The relay extension exposes the state of the relay
via the method `active`, which returns the value
true when the circuit is energized.

The following program uses the `setActive` method to
close the relay (on press of button A) and to open
the relay (on press of button B). Event handlers for
the relay are fired for the change in state. Finally,
on press of buttons A and B simultaneously, the
state of the relay is queryed using the `active`
method:

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    modules.relay1.setActive(true)
})

input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    modules.relay1.setActive(false)
})
```
