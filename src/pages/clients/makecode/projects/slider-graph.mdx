# Slider graph

Whenever you need to "see" the values of a sensor, `led plot bar graph` is a great tool to turn the micro:bit screen into a visulization tool.

## LED graph

Place the `led plot bar graph` in a `forever` loop and drop the block you want to `see`. In this example, we'll visualize the position of a slider
which ranges from `0` to `100`.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    modules.potentiometer1.position(),
    0
    )
})
```

## Got a scale?

If you know the maximum value of the sensor, like 100% in the case of the slider, enter that value in the block as well to get a better rendering.
Otherwise it will automatically try to figure out the maximum based on previous data.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    modules.potentiometer1.position(),
    100
    )
})
```


## Test your counter in the simulator

It's time to test your code using the Jacdac simulator. If you haven't started a `potentiometer` simulator yet,
click on **Start simulators** to get one.
Try moving the slider to change the graph on screen.

## Download to your micro:bit V2

Connect your micro:bit V2, slot it into the Jacdaptor and connect a Jacdac slider.
Press the **Download** button to get your code running on the micro:bit. Happy smashing!
