# Light Sound Bender

Bending sounds by changing the start frequency and end frequency of `play sound` using the micro:bit light sensor and a [Jacdac light level sensor](/clients/makecode/extensions/lightlevel).

## Play a sound

Let's start by dragging `play sound` block from the `music` toolbox into the `forever` loop.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(WaveShape.Sine, 5000, 0, 255, 0, 500, SoundExpressionEffect.None, InterpolationCurve.Linear), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Bending the start frequency

The micro:bit can sense the light level ([by using the screen in reverse??!?](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/input/light-level)) so we'll start by dragging the `input.light level` block
as a start frequency. Since the light level is without between 0 and 255, we roughly multiply it by 100 to generate frequencies between 0 and 25500Hz (100 x 255).

-   click on the (+) button in the play sound to expand the options
-   drag a `(*)` multiply block from Math and set one side as `100`
-   drag a `light level` block from the `input` toolbox

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(WaveShape.Sine, 100 * input.lightLevel(), 0, 255, 0, 500, SoundExpressionEffect.None, InterpolationCurve.Linear), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Bending the end frequency

We'll read the light (slider) position and use it as a **end frequency** in play sound.
Since the position is in percent, we'll multiply the value by 200 to get frequencies up to 20000Hz range (200 x 100%).

-   click on the (+) button in the play sound to expand the options
-   drag a `(*)` multiply block from Math and set one side as `200`
-   drag a `light level 1 light level (%)` block from the `modules` toolbox
-   if you cannot find this block, start a _light level_ simulator in Jacdac and click **ADD BLOCKS** button

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(WaveShape.Sine, 100 * input.lightLevel(), 200 * modules.potentiometer1.position(), 255, 0, 500, SoundExpressionEffect.None, InterpolationCurve.Linear), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Test in the simulator

It's time to test your code using the Jacdac simulator. If you haven't started a `potentiometer` simulator yet,
click on **Start simulators** to get one.
Try moving the sliders to test the different sounds.

## Download to your micro:bit V2

Connect your micro:bit V2, slot it into the Jacdaptor and connect a Jacdac slider.
Press the **Download** button to get your code running on the micro:bit.
