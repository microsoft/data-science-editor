# Slider bender

Bending sounds by changing the start frequency of `play sound` using a [potentiometer (slider)](/clients/makecode/extensions/slider).

## Play a sound

Let's start by dragging `play sound` block from the `music` toolbox into the `forever` loop.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(WaveShape.Sine, 5000, 0, 255, 0, 500, SoundExpressionEffect.None, InterpolationCurve.Linear), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Bending the sound

We'll read the potentiometer (slider) position and use it as a starting frequency in play sound.
Since the position is in percent, we'll multiply the value by 100 to get frequencies up to 10000Hz range (100 x 100%).

-   click on the (+) button in the play sound to expand the options
-   drag a `(*)` multiply block from Math and set one side as `100`
-   drag a `potentiometer 1 position (%)` block from the `modules` toolbox
-   if you cannot find this block, start a _potentiometer_ simulator in Jacdac and click **Import blocks**

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    music.playSoundEffect(music.createSoundEffect(WaveShape.Sine, 100 * modules.potentiometer1.position(), 0, 255, 0, 500, SoundExpressionEffect.None, InterpolationCurve.Linear), SoundExpressionPlayMode.UntilDone)
})
```

## Test your counter in the simulator

It's time to test your code using the Jacdac simulator. If you haven't started a `potentiometer` simulator yet,
click on **Start simulators** to get one.
Try moving the slider to test the different sounds.

## Download to your micro:bit V2

Connect your micro:bit V2, slot it into the Jacdaptor and connect a Jacdac slider.
Press the **Download** button to get your code running on the micro:bit. Happy smashing!
