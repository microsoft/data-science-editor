# User guide

Please remember that Jacdac only works with the micro:bit V2, though you
can create programs that use the micro:bit and Jacdac simulators without any hardware.

## Jacdac simulators and physical modules

You can use a mix of Jacdac simulators or actual Jacdac modules when programming
the micro:bit. The micro:bit simulator can access physical Jacdac modules connected
to the micro:bit V2 (via a [Jacdaptor](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/))
provided you also have connected MakeCode
to the micro:bit [using WebUSB](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/usb/webusb).

In the example below, we remove the button simulator and
connect a physical keycap module which implements the button service.
The Micro:bit simulator connects to the physical button and uses it in the code.

## Dongle mode: "Only one brain"

To avoid having the micro:bit simulator **and** the physical micro:bit running code **at the same time**,
Jacdac automatically puts one of the two micro:bits in a **dongle mode** when restarting the simulator or
resetting the physical device,
or downloading code into the physical device (which ends with a a reset of the device).
The micro:bit in dongle mode does not execute the user's program.

-   in dongle mode, the micro:bit scrolls `JACDAC DONGLE MODE PRESS A TO RESET`
-   to exit dongle mode, **press any button or reset** - either the simulator or the physical device

A simulator restart or device reset changes dongle mode as follows:

-   when a physical micro:bit resets, the simulator micro:bit enters dongle mode.
-   when the simulator micro:bit restarts, the physical micro:bit enters dongle mode.
-   in dongle mode, the physical micro:bit still transmits the Jacdac packets, so you can see physical services, but does not execute MakeCode code.

## Multiple Roles

When running your code, Jacdac binds the modules detected on the bus with the **roles** defined in your program.
Each service comes with a default role which is typically what you start with. For example `button1` is the default role for buttons.

```blocks
modules.button1.onEvent(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Up, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
})
```

However, if you want to create a program with multiple buttons, you will need to define additional roles in your program.

### Blocks editor

-   Open the **Modules** drawer
-   Click **Configure Roles** to open the roles editor
-   Add and remove roles
-   Press **Save** and go back to the editor

Once reloaded, you should be able to select your roles in the block drop downs.

### JavaScript editor

Unfortunately, the role editor is not yet available in the JavaScript view. So you are left with two choices

1. go to blocks, add roles, go back to JavaScript
2. add the roles manually by instantiating clients, as shown below

```
export const dotMatrix2 = new modules.DotMatrixClient("dot Matrix2")
```

## Role lifecycle

Each role, like `button1` defined in the MakeCode program needs to be bound to a server (module) before it starts to operate.
When the micro:bit starts or when a new module is plugged, it may take a couple seconds before roles around bound (there is some time needed to discover modules on the bus).
This means that typically roles are not yet bound when running the `on start` block.

Instead of using `on start`, you can use `on connected` and `on disconnected`
to start or stop using a role.

```blocks
modules.button1.onDisconnected(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
})
modules.button1.onConnected(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
})
```

## Updating Jacdac Extensions

Sometimes, you may have to update the Jacdac extension used in your project. This happens when we fix a bug or add a new feature!

-   switch to Javascript using the language button
-   expand the **Explorer** tree view
-   click on the update icon next to the jacdac extension entry
-   That's it!
