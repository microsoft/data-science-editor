# Getting started

** You do not need any hardware to do this tutorial. **

In this tutorial, we'll install the tool and build a small
application that controls an LED with a button.

## Get the package

-   on Raspberry Pi, follow the [configuration instructions](/clients/python/raspberry-pi)
-   install the `jacdac-python` package,

```bash copy
python -m pip install --upgrade --user jacdac-python
```

## Launch the [developer tools](/clients/python/devtools/)

Start a devtools server and open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/).
We'll be able to create simulated buttons in the dashboard.

```bash copy
python -m jacdac.devtools
```

## Let's code!

Let's build a blinking LED light project, assuming you have a [LED](/services/led) module.

The first step is to start a Jacdac `Bus` instance. The bus instance will automatically try to connect to the [developer tools](/clients/python/devtools);
but there are many other configuration options (see also how to use configuration files).

```python
from jacdac import Bus

bus = Bus()
```

Next we create an LED service client (and assign it the `led` role).
The client will allow us to change the color on the LED module.

```python
from jacdac.led import LedClient

led = LedClient(bus, "led")
```

Finally, we create a loop with a couple `sleep` command to
toggle between blue and red.

```python
led.brightness = 0.5
while True:
    print("blue")
    led.set_all((0,0,255))
    sleep(1)
    print("off")
    led.set_all((0,0,0))
    sleep(1)
```

All together, we get:

```python filename=blinky.py copy
from jacdac import Bus
from jacdac.led import LedClient
from time import sleep

bus = Bus()
led = LedClient(bus, "led")
led.brightness = 0.5
while True:
    print("blue")
    led.set_all((0,0,255))
    sleep(1)
    print("off")
    led.set_all((0,0,0))
    sleep(1)
```
