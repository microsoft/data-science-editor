## Overview

Jacdac.NET provides strongly-typed [clients](/clients/dotnet/clients) 
that allow to interact with Jacdac physical or simulated modules.

The client layer is built on top of the [JDom](/clients/dotnet/jdom/),
an object model of the Jacdac bus, devices and services.

The JDom layer communicates the transport layer to transfer packets.
The transports use SPI, USB, UART, Web sockets depending on the platform and available hardware.
