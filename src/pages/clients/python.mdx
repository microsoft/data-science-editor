# Jacdac Python

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into desktop **Python** projects,
including on Raspberry Pi.

-   [GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-python)
-   [API Reference](https://jacdac-python.readthedocs.io/)

## PyPi Package

Add [jacdac-python](https://pypi.org/project/jacdac-python/) to your project using `pip` (or `pip3` on Windows)

```
pip install jacdac-python
```

## Connecting to hardware

The transport used to connect to the Jacdac device typically varies a lot dependending on the platform and the usage scenario.

### JacHAT

A JacHAT is a Jacdac adapter for the Raspberry Pi that provides an SPI bridge to the Jacdac bus.

* [JM SPI bridge](/devices/microsoft/research/jmspibridgev37v37)

### USB/Serial

Connection to USB or serial device is not yet supported.

## Getting started

Let's learn about Jacdac by creating a couple small projects.

### Developer tools

The first step of a Jacdac project is to create a bus which will handle all the communication and
the management of the service client.
Since the bus communicates with hardware, configuring it may vary **a lot** whether you are on a Raspberry Pi or a desktop computer.

To provide a consistent experience, we recommend using the Jacdac developer tools.
The developer tools rely on the browser WebUSB/WebSerial/WebBluetooth to connect to the hardware devices and uses a local web socket server
to pipe the packets to the Python SDK. This also allows to debug your Python code in a virtual machine with no hardware access, like GitHub codespaces.

-   install Node.JS
-   install Jacdac command line tool (`jacdac-cli`)

```
(sudo) npm install -g jacdac-cli
```

-   launch the devtools server (and keep it running)

```
jacdac devtools
```

Once the devtools server is running, you should be able to navigate to the local web server and see a dashboard.

### Blinky

Let's build a blinking LED light project, assuming you have a [LED](/services/led) module.

The first step is to start a Jacdac `Bus` instance. The bus instance will automatically try to connect to the devtools;
but there are many other configuration options (see also how to use configuration files).

```python
from jacdac import Bus

bus = Bus()
```

Next we create an LED service client (and assign it the `led` role).
The client will allow us to change the color on the LED module.

```python
from jacdac.led import LedClient

led = LedClient(bus, "led")
```

Finally, we create a loop with a couple `sleep` command to
toggle between blue and red.

```python
speed = 64
brightness = 128
while True:
    # blue
    led.animate(0, 0, brightness, speed)
    sleep(1)
    # red
    led.animate(brightness, 0, 0, speed)
    sleep(1)
```

All together, we get:

```python
from jacdac import Bus
from jacdac.led import LedClient
from time import sleep

bus = Bus()
led = LedClient(bus, "led")

speed = 64
brightness = 128
while True:
    # blue
    led.animate(0, 0, brightness, speed)
    sleep(1)
    # off
    led.animate(0, 0, 0, speed)
    sleep(1)
```

### Slidy Blinky

Let's add a [slider](/services/potentiometer) to control the brightness of the LED.
The potentiometer can come in various physical shapes but we can handle it all
through the `PotentiometerClient` client.

```python
from jacdac.potentiometer import PotentiometerClient

slider = PotentiometerClient(bus, "slider")
```

In the `while`, we will read the `position` of the slider into a variable.

```python
    while True:
        position = slider.position
        # position is a float in [0..100] or None
```

We need to be a bit careful about the `position` value, as it may be `None` if no sensor
is connected to the Jacdac bus. To handle this case, we add `or 0.` to default to the 0 value.

```python
    while True:
        position = slider.position or 0.
        # position is a float in [0..100]!
```

From here, we can remap the `position` float in `[0, 100]` to a `int` in `[0, 255]` for the color brightness:

```python
    while True:
        position = slider.position or 0.
        brightness = int(position / 100 * 255)
```

All together the slidy blinky sample looks like

```python
from jacdac import Bus
from jacdac.led import LedClient
from jacdac.potentiometer import PotentiometerClient
from time import sleep

def main():
    bus = Bus()
    led = LedClient(bus, "led")
    slider = PotentiometerClient(bus, "slider")
    speed = 16
    # fade between colors
    while True:
        position = slider.position or 0.
        brightness = int(position / 100. * 255.)
        # blue
        led.animate(0, 0, brightness, speed)
        sleep(1)
        # off
        led.animate(brightness, 0, 0, speed)
        sleep(1)

main()
```
