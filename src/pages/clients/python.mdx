**Beta: the python layer is still in pre-release mode and beta quality.**

Jacdac provides a Python **(3.7+)** client package to run programs on Raspberry Pi.

## PyPi Package

Add [jacdac-python](https://pypi.org/project/jacdac-python/) to your project using `pip` (or `pip3` on Windows)

## Connecting to Raspberry Pi

A JacHAT is a Jacdac adapter for the Raspberry Pi that provides an SPI bridge to the Jacdac bus.

## Developing on Linux/Windows/MacOs

Python projects can be developed on desktop Python using the [developer tools](/clients/python/devtools/).
However, connecting to hardware from desktop Python is not supported yet (USB, BLE, Serial possible in the future).
