# p5.jacdac

**p5.jacdac** integrates Jacdac with [p5\*js](https://p5js.org) to create creative coding with physical devices
with installing any drivers!

-   no driver or installation needed
-   just works from your browser
-   [Try it in the p5js editor!](https://editor.p5js.org/pelikhan/sketches/ad1hCFqFF)

## Usage

Use the online version (recommended) and add it to the head section of your HTML document.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/p5.jacdac.js"></script>
```

or download the [p5.jacdac.js](https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/p5.jacdac.js) locally

```html
<script src="./p5.jacdac.js"></script>
```

```p5js
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/p5@1.4.0/lib/p5.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/p5.jacdac.js"></script>
    <script src="sketch.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400)
}
function draw() {
    const { potentiometer } = jacdac.sensors
    const [r = 0, g = 0, b = 0] = potentiometer
    background(r * 255, g * 255, b * 255)
}
```

That's it! `p5.jacdac` will automatically show a button to connect to your
device and hide it when connected.

## What's next?

-   [sensors](/clients/p5js/sensors), use sensor data in your sketches
-   [events](/clients/p5js/events), register handlers for events
