# MakeCode Extensions

Write programs using Jacdac modules in [MakeCode](https://makecode.com).

-   [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
-   [MakeCode Arcade (beta)](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta/)
-   [Maker (beta)](https://maker.makecode.com/)

The [pxt-jacdac repository](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac) contains MakeCode support for many Jacdac services.
Each Jacdac service is represented by a separate MakeCode [extension](./makecode/extensions) within
the `pxt-jacdac` repository.

This guide is targetted at the [micro:bit V2](https://www.microbit.org/)
but it can be applied to other editors.

## Before you code...

The **[Out of the box program](/hardware/kit/oob/)** is a Jacdac program
that automatically interacts with modules and the micro:bit v2 sensors.
Before getting into coding Jacdac programs, you can try it out to experiment with
sensors.

**!!Heads up!!** make sure that you get the Jacdapter with number facing you!

## Getting started

-   Open [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
-   Open or create a new project.
-   Add the **Jacdac** extension.
-   You should see a **Modules** drawer in the toolbox.

### First connection with a micro:bit V2

If you have a program that does not use Jacdac on the micro:bit V2, from MakeCode or micropython, you will want to start
by downloading an empty program **using Jacdac** onto the micro:bit V2.

-   Click on the menu of the **Download** button, do not connect to the micro:bit V2.
-   Drag and drop the generated .hex file onto the `MICROBIT` drive as usual.

### Connecting to a micro:bit V2

In the editor, you can connect your micro:bit V2 and the editor will automatically communicate with the physical Jacdac modules.

-   Click on the menu of the **Download** button and select **Connect Device** and follow the instructions.
-   Download your program at least once, even if it's empty, so that you get the latest Jacdac runtime in the micro:bit.

### Adding blocks for services

When a Jacdac device (physical or simulated) is detected, MakeCode can automatically determine which **extensions** are needed to program with it.

-   After connecting, plug **one or more** modules to the micro:bit. You should see them appear in the **Devices** section.
-   Click on **Add Blocks** to add the extensions for these modules' services in your project.
-   Open the **Modules** drawer in you will find the blocks for your service.

** Pro tip: you need to repeat this procedure if you use other module types! **

### Using device simulators

You can start simulators for any Jacdac service. This is useful if you do not have the hardware module or you want to simulate specific condition... like freezing temperatures!

For example, to **start a button simulator**,

-   Click on the plus (+) icon in the Jacdac dashboard and select `button`.
-   You should see a button appear in the simulator section of the Jacdac dashboard.
-   Click on **Add Blocks** and follow the same procedure as for physical modules.

Great you've got your first Jacdac program running on the micro:bit!
