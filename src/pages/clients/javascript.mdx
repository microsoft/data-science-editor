# JavaScript/TypeScript package

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into your web or Node.JS projects.

## JDOM

The JDOM module is a dependency-free JavaScript object model 
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements and allows sending commands as well. JDOM also handles connection through WebUSB, WebBLE and other transports.

* [JDOM reference](/clients/javascript/jdom)

## NPM

Add the [jacdac-ts npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jacdac-ts) module 
to your project

```
npm install --save jacdac-ts
```
or
```
yarn add jacdac-ts
```

then import components as needed using ES6 import syntax

```javascript
import { createUSBBus } -ts
const jd = createUSBBus()
```

## CDN / UMD

You can also use CDN services to import ``jacdac`` into your html page directly.
This will load the ES6 build of the library.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts@VERSION/dist/jacdac.js"></script>
```

where ``@VERSION`` is the desired version.
