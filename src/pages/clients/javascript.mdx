# JavaScript/TypeScript package

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into your web or Node.JS projects.

-   [GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/react-jacdac)
-   [API reference](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/) for a full list of functions.

## JDOM

The JDOM module is a dependency-free JavaScript object model
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements and allows sending commands as well.
JDOM also handles connection through WebUSB, WebSerial, WebBLE and other transports.

-   [API Reference](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/)
-   [JDOM introduction](/clients/javascript/jdom)
    -   [Bus](/clients/javascript/jdom/bus/)
    -   [Device](/clients/javascript/jdom/device/)
    -   [Service](/clients/javascript/jdom/service/)
    -   [Register](/clients/javascript/jdom/register/)
    -   [Event](/clients/javascript/jdom/event/)

## NPM

Add the [jacdac-ts npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jacdac-ts) module
to your project

```
npm install --save jacdac-ts
```

or

```
yarn add jacdac-ts
```

then import components as needed using ES6 import syntax

```vanilla
import { createWebBus } from "jacdac-ts"
const bus = createWebBus()
-----

```

The connection flow must be started from a user interaction, typically a button click.

```javascript
// you have a button with id = connectbtn somewhere
const connectEl = document.getElementById("connectbtn")
connectEl.onclick = () => (bus.connected ? bus.disconnect() : bus.connect())
```

## CDN / UMD

You can also use CDN services to import `jacdac` into your html page directly.
This will load the UMD build of the library.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/jacdac.umd.js"></script>
```
