# JavaScript/TypeScript package

Jacdac provides a rich Javascript package to interact with physical and simulated devices
over USB, Serial or Bluetooth. This package is powering this web site.

## JDOM

The JDOM module is a dependency-free JavaScript object model
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements and allows sending commands as well.
JDOM also handles connection through WebUSB, WebSerial, WebBLE and other transports.

## Getting started

Add the [jacdac-ts npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jacdac-ts) module
to your project

```bash copy
npm install --save jacdac-ts
```

or

```bash copy
yarn add jacdac-ts
```

then import components as needed using ES6 import syntax

```vanilla
import { createWebBus } from "jacdac-ts"
const bus = createWebBus()
-----

```

The connection flow must be started from a user interaction, typically a button click.

```javascript
// you have a button with id = connectbtn somewhere
const connectEl = document.getElementById("connectbtn")
connectEl.onclick = () => (bus.connected ? bus.disconnect() : bus.connect())
```

## CDN / UMD

You can also use CDN services to import `jacdac` into your html page directly.
This will load the UMD build of the library.

```html copy
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/jacdac.js"></script>
```
