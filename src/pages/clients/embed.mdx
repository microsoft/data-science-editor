# IFrame hosted Jacdac

This tools page can be hosted in HTML IFrame elements in order 
to integrate Jacdac into your web site with a minimum of JavaScript.

## Embedded HTML

The following HTML snippt inserts a Jacdac IFrame in the page 
(skinning the IFrame is beyond this guide as it is typically web site specific).

```html copy
<iframe
    style="width: 100%; height: 27rem; border: none;"
    allow="usb;serial;bluetooth"
    sandbox="allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-same-origin"
    aria-label="Jacdac tools"
    src="https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/tools/collector?embed=1" />
```

Here is the live example. Make sure to disconnect Jacdac in this page before trying it out in the hosted page below.

<iframe
    style="width: 100%; height: 27rem; border: none;"
    allow="usb;serial;bluetooth"
    sandbox="allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-same-origin"
    aria-label="Jacdac tools"
    src="https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/tools/collector?embed=1" />
