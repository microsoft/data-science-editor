# Jacdac.NET on Raspberry Pi

Thanks to the .NET core support for Raspberry Pi, Jacdac can be used to build applications running on Raspberry Pi
that use Jacdac modules.

To run Jacdac on a Raspberry Pi and connect to Jacdac physical modules, you will need a JacHAT.

* [JacHAT bridge](/services/bridge), add the [Jacdac.NET.Transports.Spi](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jacdac.NET.Transports.Spi/) NuGet package

## "Devbox Mode"

The "Devbox mode" denotes a development setup where all the dev work is done from your uber-powerful desktop (devbox), your Jacdac application runs on your desktop (or a VM)
and communicates to the Raspberry Pi through the [devtools](/clients/dotnet/devtools).

![Visual Studio + .NET app (devbox)   <-->    web socket   <-->   devtools server (pi) <--> JacHAT <--> Jacdac modules
](./pi/devboxmode.drawio.svg)

In this mode, you get access to a full featured Visual Studio debugger and profiler, full performance of your desktop, 
while still interacting with physical and simulated sensors.

This mode will shorten your development cycle, until you are ready to test things on the "bare metal".

- install `libgpiod-dev` to support fast SPI operations. For sanity sake, reboot the pi after doing the update.

```
sudo apt install -y libgpiod-dev
```

- launch the `devtools` in internet+spi mode on the Raspberry Pi. Pro tip: from `ssh`, use `tmux` to launch the server.

```
jacdac.devtools --internet --spi
```
- navigate to `http://[raspberrypi ip]:8081/` on your local network and you should load a dashboard connected to your Pi
- use the `WebSocketTransport` in your code (from the [Jacdac.NET.Transports.WebSockets](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jacdac.NET.Transports.WebSockets/) nuget package).

```cs
using Jacdac;
using Jacdac.Transports.WebSockets;
...
var bus = new JDBus(WebSocketTransport.Create());
```

- launch or debug your .NET app and it will connect automatically to your hardware through the devtools

## Raspberry Pi Mode

The "Pi mode" denotes a development where the .NET application runs on the Pi operating system and communicates directly to the JacHAT.

```
Visual Studio --> publish & copy                       .NET app <--> JacHAT <--> Jacdac modules
devbox                                                 pi
```

In this mode, it is still possible to debug the .NET app by attaching to the process, and also use the devtools; but there is a bit
more friction in the development flow.

- launch the `devtools` in internet mode on the Raspberry Pi. Do **not** use `--spi` or it will lock the JacHAT
```
jacdac.devtools --internet
```
- navigate to `http://[raspberrypi ip]:8081/` on your local network and you should load a dashboard. You will notice that it is not connected to the Jacdac modules.
- add the `SpiTransport` transport from the [Jacdac.NET.Transports.Spi](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jacdac.NET.Transports.Spi/) nuget package.

```cs
using Jacdac;
using Jacdac.Transports.WebSockets;
using Jacdac.Transports.Spi;
...
var bus = new JDBus(WebSocketTransport.Create());
bus.AddTransport(SpiTransport.Create());
```

- publish and copy your .NET application to the Pi
- launch your .NET app on the Pi and you will see that the dashboard now "sees" the Jacdac connected modules.
- back in Visual Studio, you can also attach to your application to start a debugging session

## What's next? Blinky!

Now that your development environment is ready, try to build [Blinky](/clients/dotnet/projects/blinky)!

## Troubleshooting

If you are using other application that talk SPI, the pins might have been locked and not properly released. A reboot typically takes care of fixing things.
