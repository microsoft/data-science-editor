# IoT Plug And Play Models

This route hosts [DTDL](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) models 
for each [service](/services), similar to https://devicemodels.azure.com/.

The [DTMI](https://github.com/Azure/digital-twin-model-identifier) of each services is formatted based on the class identifier:

    dtmi:jacdac:services:x{id};1

where ``{id}`` is the class identifer rendered as a hex number. 
The route is generated following the conventions from [iot-plugandplay-models](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models#consuming)
where the ``:`` are replaced by ``/``, and ``;`` with ``-``.

    /dtmi/jacdac/services/x{id}-1.json


For example, [/dtmi/jacdac/services/x0-1.json](/dtmi/jacdac/services/x0-1.json).

To download all service models, go use [/dtmi/jacdac/services.json](/dtmi/jacdac/services.json)

## Device Twin Designer

You can compose devices from services using the [Azure Device Twin Designer](/tools/azure-device-twin-designer).
