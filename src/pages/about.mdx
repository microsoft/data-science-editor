# Data Science Editor

The **Data Science Editor** is an experimental structured editor to create data analysis programs.

## Getting started

### Cereals

Follow the video below to create a data flow
that analyses the cereal dataset and finds the cereals
with the most calories.

## Features

The editor works in the browser and you don't need to install any additional software.
It comes with a few built-in datasets but it is also possible to import your own CSV data.

### "Data flows through blocks"

Each data blocks holds a dataset and acts as a transformation pipeline to the next block. The pipeline looks as follows:

-   a data block receives an updated dataset from its predecessor
-   (optionally) the data block transforms the dataset. For example, it can sort the data according to a column.
-   (optionally) update charts or tables
-   the data block pushes the data to its successors

### ðŸ‘€ Data preview

The data blocks have a data preview button ðŸ‘€ that allows to quickly glance at the dataset attached to the block. If a block also transforms the dataset, a before/after view is provided.

### Loading and Saving projects

It is possible to load and save projects from files.

> Supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge 90+ only!

The data editor will save projects as an entire folder, which allows to save the block code and additional data files. Copy those folders to share them with others.

### Importing CSV/TSV/JSON datasets

You can load data file hosted on internet using `load dataset from url`. The data must be CSV/TSV formated with header names
or a JSON array of objects.

It is possible to import files using `load dataset from file` (Chrome/Edge only).
Imported datasets are stored as files in the project folder. This allows to share a project and all of its additional data. If you modify the files outside the data editor, refresh the page to reload your changes.

### Import "comment" datasets

To avoid needing a file the `load dataset from comment` lets you copy/paste the data in the block comment.

#### Size limitations

The data science editor is meant for reasonably sized datasets (< 10 Mb). Various visualizations and charts will start dropping data in order to keep the editor responsive.

## Embedding

The Data Science Editor can be embedded and additional blocks can be contributed. See [embed documentation](/embed/).

## GitHub

The editor is open source at https://github.com/microsoft/data-science-editor .
