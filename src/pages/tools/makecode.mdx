# MakeCode

> We are currently working on an integration of Jacdac into the MakeCode code editors.
This process is still in progress and subject to change.

## Editors

Jacdac is available in the following editors:

* micro:bit beta https://makecode.microbit.org/beta, "Editor Extensions" experiment required
* MakeCode Arcade beta https://arcade.makecode.com/beta
* Maker https://maker.makecode.com/

To turn on Editor Extensions, click on **About**, then **Experiments** and **Editor Extensions**.

You can also code side-by-side using the multi editor https://makecode.com/multi?jacdac=1

### Configuring modules

Create a **new project**, click on **Extensions** in the settings project. 
Search for ``jacdac`` and import **https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac**.

After the project reload, you should see a **modules** toolbox.

Open the **modules** toolbox, click on **Configure** which will open the Jacdac configuration
dialog.

Add the modules that you want to use in your project, each module has a role:
the **left button**, the **head sensor**, etc... The configuration dialog
prepare your project for those modules when you click on **Save**.

Once you are back in the editor, you will find new blocks to use those modules
and you will also find the roles of those modules in the drop down of each block.

### Simulator vs hardware

As soon as your program uses Jacdac modules, a dedicated simulator pane will open
and will allow you to test your code with or without hardware.

If the simulator is running and a physical device is connected, 
the simulator always takes precedence:
If the the simulator is running, the physical device is paused.
If the simulator is stopped, the physical device is unpaused and used as a Jacdac device.

## Local Development

This is a special section for the Jacdac/MakeCode team to debug the setup.

## TODO

- [ ] ondemand virtual device
- [ ] support for rendering makecode snippets

```blocks
let x = 0;
```


```blocks
let y = 0

```blocks

})
```

```blocks

namespace myModules {
    //% fixedInstance block="foot"
    export const foot = new modules.AccelerometerClient("foot");
}

myModules.foot.onEvent(jacdac.AccelerometerEvent.TiltUp, function() {
    
})
```
