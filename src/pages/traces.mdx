## Trace format

Jacdac traces can be created by recording them in this web site
and saving them to files. The trace file contains enough information
to replay all the packets.

```
DESCRIPTION

TIMESTAMP PACKET_HEX INFO
...
```

where

* ``DESCRIPTION`` is a Markdown-formatted description of the trace.
* ``TIMESTAMP`` is the timestamp of the packet, in milliseconds
* ``PACKET_HEX`` is the packet header and data formatted as a hex buffer
* ``INFO`` is the human readable description of the packet, ignored by the parser

The traces are stored at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/traces.
