## Jacdaptors

Jacdac can provide a convenient way to add functionality to existing electronics prototyping platforms including micro:bit, Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
This requires suitable firmware to be developed and a physical layer adaptor that providing a suitable electrical interface to a Jacdac connector.
We call this a _Jacdaptor_. A USB Jacdaptor allows a Jacdac bus to be connected to a laptop or desktop.
WebUSB allows browser-based applications to connect to the Jacdac bus.  The current set of Jacdaptors includes:
- [KittenBot's Jacdaptor](/devices/kittenbot/jacdaptorformicrobitv2v10) for the [micro:bit V2](/devices/microbit-educational-foundation/microbitv2/), programmable via [MakeCode](/clients/makecode)
- [Raspberry Pi](/devices/microsoft-research/jmspibridgev37v37), programmable via [Python](/clients/python), [.NET](/clients/dotnet), or [JavaScript](/clients/javascript)
- [USB](/devices/microsoft-research/jmbrainf441v02), to a laptop/desktop programmable via [Python](/clients/python), [.NET](/clients/dotnet), or [JavaScript](/clients/javascript)

In the above cases, the Jacaptor bridges the Jacdac bus to an existing programmable device (micro:bit, Raspberry Pi, Laptop/Desktop), or brain.

We also have created a Jacdaptor for the [Click ecosystem](https://www.mikroe.com/click) of sensors:
- [Click](/devices/microsoft-research/jmclickcolorv32)

In the above case, the Jacdaptor extends the Jacdac bus to an existing ecosystem of sensors, or module.
