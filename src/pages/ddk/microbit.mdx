# micro:bit Accessories

Jacdac can be integrated into existing and future micro:bit accessories with different level of investment.
Jacdac brings **simulators** and **digital twins** of sensors/actuators:

-   **simulators** allows the user to easily test sensor/actuator without having to use the hardware
-   **digital twins** provides a live view on the physical sensor/actuator state in the editor
-   **standardized blocks** provided by the Jacdac project, means you have to maintain less extensions for your hardware

As of today, Jacdac runs on **micro:bit V2** exclusively and uses pin **12**.

## [Software only Jacdac](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/) for Existing accessories

The accessory sensors and actuators are surfaced as Jacdac servers by wrapping the existing extension into a Jacdac compatibility layer.
This solution adds no cost and will work for existing accessories.

-   Pros
    -   **retrofit existing accessories**
    -   simulation
    -   digital twin
    -   no modification to existing extension code
    -   same github repository for code
-   Cons
    -   extension required
    -   no Jacdac connector
    -   micro:bit v2 only (Jacdac is not supported on v1)

**[Get started with Software only Jacdac](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/)**

## Low Powered physical connector

In this scenario, you integrate one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design#pcb-edge-connector) into your design, 
with the Jacdac line connected to micro:bit pin 12 through the required [signal conditioning](/ddk/design#signalling) circuit
and a [low power supply](/ddk/design/#overview-of-jacdac-power-sharing) circuit.

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no modification to existing extension code
    -   same github repository for code
    -   Powered connector means module will just work when connected
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   extension required
    -   additional cost for power regulator
    -   micro:bit v2 only (Jacdac is not supported on v1)

Note that if your accessory already has a power regulator, you might already have the required circuitery in place.
For reference about integrating Jacdac with an edge connector, see the [Jacdaptor board schematics](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/altium/reference-designs/JacdacMicroBitShieldLP%2029-0.6).

## Onboard Jacdac server with MCU

In this scenario, the accessory contains an MCU that implements the Jacdac server protocol.
In this case, you do not need to provide any extension as the user will be able to use the built-in Jacdac client libraries.

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no extension required
    -   compatible with any Jacdac hardware, including Raspberry Pi
-   Cons
    -   MCU and power regulator circuitery add cost

## Unpowered physical connector

In this scenario, you integrate one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design#pcb-edge-connector) into your design, 
with the `JD_DATA` line connected to micro:bit pin 12 through the required [signal conditioning](/ddk/design#signalling) circuit. The power line is **not** connected.

On the software side, the same approach applies in Software-Only Jacdac.

This approach is not recommended as it will lead
to a confusing experience for users where
modules won't be powered unless another power module
is on the Jacdac line.

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no modification to existing extension code
    -   same github repository for code
    -   Jacdac connector at minimal cost
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   extension required
    -   Unpowered connector means user has to add a power source on the Jacdac bus
    -   micro:bit v2 only (Jacdac is not supported on v1)
