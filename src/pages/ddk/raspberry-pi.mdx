# Jacdac/Raspberry Pi Interoperability

Users of Raspberry Pi can take advantage of the instant 'connect and code' nature of Jacdac via support for [Python](/clients/python), [.NET](/clients/dotnet), or [JavaScript](/clients/javascript), with the help of a Raspberry Pi [Jacdaptor](/start/jacdaptors/). 

<DeviceSpecificationList tags={["adapter", "pi"]} />

Due to the real-time requirements associated with running the Jacdac protocol, we recommend that Jacdaptors for Raspberry Pi incorporate an external microcontroller (MCU). The same MCU can also run the high current power provider protocol (see [power supply sharing options](/ddk/design/electrical/#power-supply-sharing-options)), and given the relatively high current requirements of running a Pi we recommend that Raspberry Pi Jacdaptors are implemented as high current power providers.
