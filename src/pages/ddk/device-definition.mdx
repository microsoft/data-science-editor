## Device Definition

The Jacdac project maintains a catalog of known [devices](/devices/)
in the [Jacdac repository](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac).
Any manufacturer of Jacdac device is encouraged to add their own devices
to the catalog following the instructions below.

Refer to [device development](/ddk) for specific information about designing and manufacturing Jacdac devices.

## Catalog format

The device catalog is stored as JSON and JPEG images,
organized under the [Jacdac devices](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/devices) folder.
Each company may create a new folder for their devices (or multiple folders for product families).

### Device specification

A device is specified by a JSON file and an image file (see below).
The JSON schema is defined by the `jdspec.DeviceSpec` interface
in `jdspec.d.ts`.

**To register new devices, use the [device registration](/tools/device-registration/) editor.**

### QR Code

We recommend adding a QR code on your module PCB that points back to an information page. To help with the process,
the [device QR code generator](/tools/device-qr-code/) will generate Altium/Eagle/KiCAD/PNG files for you.

### Image

Each device file, (e.g. `mydevice.md`), should be accompanied by a JPEG picture of the device, (e.g. `mydevice.jpg`). The photo should be taken with:

-   4:3 aspect ratio,
-   at least size 1024x768,
-   pure white background, and 
-   a 45° isometric perspective tilting to the right with the mounting hole 1 notch at the top left.

To take the photo with the correct perspective, you might want to print out and cut out the template in these instructions. This makes it easier to adjust the tilt of the camera to make photos consistent. 

## Firmware updates

Firmware updates can be hosted as **UF2 files** of GitHub repositories.
Upon detecting a device with the specified firmware identifier,
Jacdac will automatically query the device catalog for the firmware repository, and download the latest firmware.

-   example [jacdac-msr-modules releases](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-msr-modules/tree/main/dist)

The procedure runs as follows:

-   detect device on the bus
-   query firmware identifier register in the control service
-   identify device in device catalog
-   query latest release from GitHub in the listed repository (using [semver](https://semver.org/)), download the **firmware.uf2** asset
-   compare firmware version on device to latest firmware and notify user of available device

### Building your firmware

You can concatenate all your built firmwares into a single **.uf2** file,
which should be named `firmware.uf2` when uploaded to an asset.
