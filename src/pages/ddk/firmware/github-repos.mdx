## Github Repository List

The Jacdac stack is layered, top-down, into Github repos as follows:

### Service and device catalogs

-   [Jacdac spec](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac) repository has pre-generated
    [C header files](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/dist/c)
    (JSON, TypeScript, and Python are also available there)

### Platform-independent firmware

-   [Jacdac-C](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c) contains a platform-agnostic C99 implementation
    of the Jacdac protocol and a number of [I2C drivers](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c/tree/main/drivers)
    and [servers](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c/tree/main/services);
    this repo includes the Jacdac spec repo as submodule

### Platform-specific firmware
-   [Jacdac for STM32x0](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0) contains a platform-specific implementation of
    the Single Wire Serial protocol, as well as I2C, SPI, pins, etc. that are used by Jacdac-C;
    this works with STM32G0xx and STM32F0xx series of MCUs

-   [Jacdac for PADAUK](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) contains
    an implementation of [a few servers](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk/tree/main/services)
    for a low-cost PADAUK family of 8-bit MCUs (they are $0.03-$0.08 depending on capabilities in normal circumstances)

-   [Jacdac for ESP32](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-esp32) contains an implementation of WiFi and TCP (with TLS) servers, but is a bit outdated; we're working on supporting ESP32 as a brain

### Module template
-   [Jacdac module template](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-module-template) is a simplified repo to get started with a new module based on STM3260
 
### MSR prototypes

-   [Jacdac MSR Modules](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-msr-modules) ties all of the above together
    to provide firmware for a number of prototype modules that we have made;
    you would normally [use that repo as a template](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0/blob/main/README.md)
    for your own firmware
