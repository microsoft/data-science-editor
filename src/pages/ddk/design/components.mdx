# Selecting Components for Jacdac Devices

This page presents some information about part selection for some of the key components of many Jacdac devices. 

## Microcontrollers

The cheapest prototype Jacdac module implementations were based on PADAUK microcontrollers, and more specifically the PMS150C-U6 and PFS122-S08. The PMS150C is the cheapest but is one-time programmable and doesn't lend itself to in-circuit programming so must be programmed before being fitted. It is also very resource-constrained. The PFS122 has more RAM and program memory, supports analog input, and is re-programmable with a relatively low voltage that's compatible with in-circuit programming. 

For more sophisticated Jacdac modules, for example when more memory or particular peripherals are needed - such as I2C or SPI - the STM32G030 processors work well. We use the [STM32G030F6P6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32g030f6.html) TSSOP-20 variant in a lot of our designs.

Other microcontrollers should work fine too of course. 

## Schottky diodes

The obvious Schottky diode choice for clamping the JD_DATA line is a dual, series-connected BAT54-S. There are many variants of this. 

For designs that provide power delivery and/or have different options for power consumption, a higher-current Schottky diode with a low forward voltage drop is required. 

## ESD diodes

ESD diodes are recommended for Jacdac bus production for commercial module designs, since these signals will likely be exposed to ESD events. We also recommend the use of ESD protection for other electrical interfaces such as USB. 

ESD diodes for JD_DATA protection should be ultra-low capacitance types, ideally less than 1pF but certainly no more than 4pF, in order to minimize load on the bus.
