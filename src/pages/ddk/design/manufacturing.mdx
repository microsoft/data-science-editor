# Manufacturing

## Programming and testing

The [device tester](/tools/device-tester/) page will load and run compliance tests for the connected
devices and services. You can use this page to validate that your device is behaving correctly.

### Debugging with Hack connect

The MCU can be programmed before being fitted to the device PCB, or can be programmed in-circuit. In the latter case we suggest the use of a [hack-connect](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/dbg#:~:text=Hack--,connect,-XS).

Once connected to hack connect, you can use the console view in the tools to listen for the UART output
on the device.
