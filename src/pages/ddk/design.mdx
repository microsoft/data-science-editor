# Hardware Design

## Overview 

The hardware design guidelines break down into the following sections:
- [Electrical](./electrical)
- [Electro-mechanical](./electro-mechanical)
- [Mechanical](./mechanical)
- [EC30 form factor](./ec30): if you are considering creating a Jacdac module, brain or power supply, we strongly recommend it conforms to the EC30 form factor. Hubs and Jacdaptors can also benefit from using this form factor.
- [Component selection](./components) provides information about part selection for many Jacdac devices. We also have a list of [suggested components](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/generic/suggested-components) that may be substituted in case of sourcing / supply chain difficulties. 
- [Support for device manufacturing](./manufacturing). Throughout the design of Jacdac we considered aspects of device manufacturability, to ease the process of manufacturing and testing device hardware and thereby minimize cost. 

## Reference designs

The Jacdac team and the community have provided hardware and firmware reference designs for a variety of EC30 Jacdac devices, based on very low cost components including [PADAUK](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) MCUs. We have designs in common electronics CAD tools:

- [Altium Designer](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/altium),
- [EAGLE](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/eagle), and 
- [KiCad](https://github.com/hardwaremonkey/jacdac).

In many cases the above repos also contain design files in PDF, Gerber, STEP and Parasolid form.
